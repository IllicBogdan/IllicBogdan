# About Me

Hi, I'm IliÄ‡ Bogdan, a programmer from Croatia. 

I have been coding since 2015 and I enjoy working with different technologies and languages, such as Python, Java, C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have experience in developing web applications, mobile apps, games, and software tools. I am always eager to learn new skills and improve my existing ones.

Some of my projects include:

- A website that allows users to create and share custom memes
- A mobile app that helps people find the best deals on online shopping
- A game that simulates the life of a games company
- A software tool that analyzes and optimizes the performance of video games

I am passionate about programming and I love solving problems and creating innovative solutions. I am also a friendly and collaborative person, who enjoys working in a team and sharing ideas. I am always open to new challenges and opportunities.

If you want to know more about me, you can check out my portfolio or my GitHub. You can also contact me via email or social media. I look forward to hearing from you!
